# CRISPR screens in mammalian cells

This repository contains material for the HMS Genetics Bootcamp.

## Rationale
CRISPR-based technologies have revolutionized biology. These tools enable scalable perturbations of gene function, such as knockout, knockdown, and overexpression, and combined with advances in sequencing and nucleotide synthesis, enable genome-wide screens, previously restricted to non-mammalian model organisms, directly in mammalian cells. This enables rapid generation of insights into biology relevant to human biology and disease. The goal of this lab is to provide students an overview of the logic, benefits, and limitations of CRISPR screens as well as hands-on experience in analyzing screen data and then generating testable hypotheses, such that students can deploy screens for their own research.

## Objectives
To become acquainted with CRISPR screens in mammalian cells. Students will be introduced to different screening technologies, learn the advantages and challenges of performing and interpreting these types of experiments, and gain hands-on experience in analyzing the resulting data.

## Materials
The sequencing data processing section of the course will use materials from this repo.

The CRISPR screen analysis section of the course will use the Jupyter notebook and data in this repo. The notebook can be run directly in a Binder instance [HERE](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nolanmaier/genetics_bootcamp/5c0c0b8f4ea42a017ad91468342e7340650048e9?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fscreen_analysis.ipynb).
